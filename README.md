# Project Web BLOG - NodeJS

## Initialize the Project


To set up the project, please follow these steps:

1. Start by downloading the source code. Once you have the code on your local machine, navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the project dependencies:

````bash
npm i
````

3. Once the dependencies are successfully installed, create a new file named .env in the project's root directory. This file will be used to store your configuration settings.
4. Open the .env file and configure it according to your needs. It should contain the necessary environment variables for your application to function correctly. Refer to the provided screenshot for an example of how the .env file should look:
